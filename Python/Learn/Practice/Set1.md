> "Please don't use ChatGPT or any AI for this. If you have any doubts, let's say you want to learn about 'for loops,' Google 'for loop,' or simply ask any of us to help you understand the concept, and then implement it yourselves. Have a nice day!" - Krishnachandran

## Simple Quiz Game:
Create a quiz game program that asks the user a series of questions. Implement a loop to iterate through the questions. For each question, accept the user's answer, check if it's correct, and provide feedback. If the user answers correctly, increment their score. At the end of all questions, display the user's final score and exit the program.

## Dice Rolling Simulator:
Develop a program that simulates the rolling of a six-sided die. Use a while loop to allow the user to roll the die multiple times. After each roll, display the result and ask the user if they want to roll again. Continue the loop until the user decides to exit the simulator.

## Interactive Calculator:
Build a basic calculator program that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Utilize a while loop to create an interactive experience, allowing the user to perform multiple calculations. After each calculation, display the result and provide the option for the user to continue or exit the calculator.

### You can implement it whatever way you want. :)

## How to upload

- Please create a folder with your name in the folder `Python/Workspace` (Please use full names and avoid spaces).
- Within that folder, create another folder `Practice` and inside it, create a folder `Set1`.
- Simply place your Python files there.

Bye bye!
