## About
Hi, I'm Athul Anoop, a first year CSE student. I'm interested in software development, graphic designing and embedded systems. 

## Why Flutter?
I've explored quite a few different tech stacks and was looking to learn a cross platform stack that enables native apps as opposed to web apps. Since TinkerHub brought up Flutter as a learning path, I think its a good opportunity to learn something new.
